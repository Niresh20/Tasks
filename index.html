<p>
Agile software development refers to software development methodologies centered around the idea of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.</p>

<p><b>Agile means a way of thinking</b> that's guided by 4 values and 12 principles.
 Think about agile as a mindset over framework,  process or methodology.
It was coined back in 2001, where 17 expert software developers got together in Utah to discuss what are some of the things that they were doing in software development.
They agreed on the <b>4 values and 12 principles</b> and that is how the agile manifesto was originated.

<h3>Benefits of Agile</h3>
<p>Agile was created because of the downfall of traditional waterfall methodology.  
With waterfall canâ€™t move to the next phase until the previous phase is complete.
Because of this step by step process the value isn't delivered to the end users until the end of the process and also gaining feedback from the customer takes longer period.
Agile allows us to deliver that value in smaller increments to the end users to start utilizing that solution and seeing that value also they get to give us feedback.</p>

<h1>SCRUM</h1>
<h3>Overview of scrum</h3>
<img class="imgoverview" src="img/overview.png" alt="overview">
<p>Inspect and adapt to the problems and also how the team is leveraging the scrum framework <br>
	All the roles and responsibilities on the meetings in scrum are 
designed so that team can be more transparent about how they're working.
</p>
<h1>SPRINT</h1>
<p>Sprint is just the time selected by the team anywhere between (1-4  weeks) where they plan the work along with product owner and scrum master, so we can put the software in the hands of the customer by the end of the sprint
Sprint comprises of all the scrum ceremonies. The daily stand up happens within the sprint then sprint planning, sprint review and retrospective.As it is an agile way of developing software.
